##### The main goal of OOP is to bind data and code(methods) togather.

> ## OOP provides few concepts
> 
> ### 1.  Encapsulation

* Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
* create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making private all the data members of the class. 
*  use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
* The Java Bean class or POJO class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.
* Class Diagram of Student

![student class diagram](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Advance-Java-J2EE/raw/J2EE/Student-Class1.png)

Student.java
```java
package org.cityU.Encapsulation;
public class Student {
	private String name;
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}
	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
}
``` 
StudentTest.java

```java
package org.cityU.Encapsulation;

public class StudentTest {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Student s = new Student();
		s.setName("Richard");
		
		System.out.println(s.getName());
	}
}

```
> ### 2.   Abstraction
* Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
* There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
	- Abstract class (0 to 100%)
	- Interface (100%)
	
![Abstaction class diagram](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Advance-Java-J2EE/raw/J2EE/Abstract2.png)	
	
```java
abstract class Bank {
	abstract int getRateOfInterest();
}
class HSBC extends Bank {
	int getRateOfInterest() {
		return 7;
	}
}
class BRAC extends Bank {
	int getRateOfInterest() {
		return 8;
	}
}
class TestBank {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		Bank b;
		b = new HSBC();
		System.out.println("Rate of Interest is: " + b.getRateOfInterest() + " %");
		b = new BRAC();
		System.out.println("Rate of Interest is: " + b.getRateOfInterest() + " %");
	}
}
```
Same examples you can solve with interface.

> ### 3.   Polymorphism
* Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
* There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.

#### Runtime polymorphism using interface and method overriding 

![Runtime Polymorphism using Interface](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Advance-Java-J2EE/raw/J2EE/RuntimePolymorphism.png)

#### Compiletime polymorphism using method overloading
![Compiletime Polymorphism using method overloading ](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Advance-Java-J2EE/raw/J2EE/CompileTimePolymorphism.png)
> ### 4.   Inheritance
* Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
* create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
* Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.
* ![Compiletime Polymorphism using method overloading ](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Advance-Java-J2EE/raw/J2EE/Inheritance.png)
```java
public class Employee {
	private String name;
	private double salary;
	public Employee(String name, double salary) {
		super();
		this.name = name;
		this.salary = salary;
	}
	public String getName() {
		return name;
	}
	public void setName(String name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	public double getSalary() {
		return salary;
	}
	public void setSalary(double salary) {
		this.salary = salary;
	}
}
```
```java
public class Programmer extends Employee{
	private double bonous;
	public Programmer(String name, double salary) {
		super(name, salary);
		this.bonous=bonous;
	}
	public double getBonous() {
		return bonous;
	}
	public void setBonous(double bonous) {
		this.bonous = bonous;
	}
}
```

> Apart from these, there are some other concepts which are used in Object-Oriented design:

> ### 5.   Association
* Association refers to the relationship between multiple objects.
![student class diagram](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Advance-Java-J2EE/raw/J2EE/Student-Class1.png)

> ##### 5.1. Aggregation
* Aggregation is a weak association.
* An association is said to be aggregation if both Objects can exist independently.
![Aggregation](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Advance-Java-J2EE/raw/J2EE/Aggregation.png)
```java
//Address.java
public class Address {
	private int id;
	private String line;
	private String city;
	private String country;
	//getter, setter, toString
}

//Employee.java
public class Employee {
	private long empId;
	private String empName;
	private Address address;// Aggregation
	private double salary;
	//getter, setter, toString
	}
	
//AggregationTest.java
public class AggregationTest {
public static void main(String[] args) {
	//Address object
	Address home = new Address();
	home.setId(1);
	home.setLine("Honda Goli");
	home.setCity("Dhaka");
	home.setCountry("Bangladesh");
	//Employee Object
	Employee e = new Employee();
	e.setEmpId(100);
	e.setEmpName("Richard");
	e.setSalary(10000);
	e.setAddress(home);
	System.out.println(e);
	//assign employee to null
	e = null;
    //Still exist Adsress in memory. This is called soft relationship.
	System.out.println(home);
}
}
```
> ##### 5.2. Composition
* The composition is the strong type of association.
* An association is said to composition if an Object owns another object and another object cannot exist without the owner object.
![Composition](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Advance-Java-J2EE/raw/J2EE/Composition.png)
```java
//Address.java
public class Address {
	private int id;
	private String line;
	private String city;
	private String country;
	//getter, setter, toString
}
//Employee.java
public class Employee {
	private long empId;
	private String empName;
	private Address address;// Aggregation
	private double salary;
	//Composition
	public Employee() {
		this.address = new Address();
	}
//getter,setter, toString
}
//CompositionTest.java
public class CompositionTest {
@SuppressWarnings("null")
public static void main(String[] args) {
    //when you initiated Employee, Address initiated as well. 
	Employee e = new Employee();
	e.setEmpId(100);
	e.setEmpName("Richard");
	e.setSalary(10000);
	//Get Address then set field
	e.getAddress().setId(1);
	e.getAddress().setLine("hi");
	e.getAddress().setCity("dhaka");
	e.getAddress().setCountry("BD");
	System.out.println(e);
	e = null;
	if(e!=null){
		System.out.println(e.getAddress());
	}
	else{
		System.out.println("No address");
	}
	}
}
```

> ##### 5.3. Generalization
![Generalization](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Advance-Java-J2EE/raw/J2EE/Generalization.png)
> ##### 5.4. Realization
![Realization](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Advance-Java-J2EE/raw/J2EE/Realization.png)
> ### 6. Dependency: 
A depends on B. This is a very loose relationship.
   ![dependency](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Software-Engineering/raw/Lab-Summer2019/dependency.png)
    ![dependency](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Software-Engineering/raw/Lab-Summer2019/dependency.jpg)
```java
public class Customer {
	private String customerId;
	private String customerName;
	//getter and setter
	}
```
```java
public class CustomerView {
	public void displayCustomer(Customer c){
		System.out.println("Customer Id:"+c.getCustomerId()+
				" Customer Name:"+c.getCustomerName()+" "
				);
	}
}
```
```java
public class CustomerTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Customer richard = new Customer();
		richard.setCustomerId("C001");
		richard.setCustomerName("Richard");
		CustomerView cv = new CustomerView();
		cv.displayCustomer(richard);
	}
}
```
### 7. Multiplicity
* A Teacher has between 20 to 30 students in a term, and that a student has exactly five teachers.
![Multiplicity](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Software-Engineering/raw/Lab-Summer2019/Multiplicity1.jpg)
* If a teacher had 20 or 30 students, then the class diagram.
![Multiplicity](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Software-Engineering/raw/Lab-Summer2019/Multiplicity2.jpg)
* If a teacher had zero or more students, then the class diagram.
![Multiplicity](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Software-Engineering/raw/Lab-Summer2019/Multiplicity3.jpg)
* If a teacher had one or more students,then the class diagram.
![Multiplicity](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Software-Engineering/raw/Lab-Summer2019/Multiplicity4.jpg)
```java
Class Teacher{
private String teacherId;
private String teacherName;
private List<Student> pupil;// 0 or more// 1 or more
//setter and getter
    }
}

Class Student{
private String studentId;
private String studentName;
private List<Teacher> instructors;
//setter and getter
    }
}
```
* Self Association
![SelfAssociation](https://github.com/suptaphilip/Software-Engineering/raw/Lab-Summer2019/SelfAssociation.jpg)
```java
class Person {
   private Person spouse;
   // etc.
